= Introduction =

There is no defined goal for TextMunger, beyond being useful.

For certain limited definitions of the word "useful."


= Details =

Forthcoming:
  * save and reload text-sources (if in library or local files)
  * added percentage bias to text sources
  * load SOURCE from file
  * save OUTPUT to file
  * swap OUTPUT to SOURCE, for re-processing
  * save and reload configured rule-sets
  * basic editing control for SOURCE and OUTPUT
  * more clustering random-walk for Density transform
  * put density inside of XRML format
  * drop xray-references in Markov rules
  * add explanation of rules to rule-editor (and whatever background code)
  * file-based generic replacement "translator" to read from directory
  ** ie, multiple user-controlled translators are possible
  ** that will be an issue for serialization....
  * improve display in selection editors
  * allow controls to resize when form is resized
  * separation of operation from GUI, so can be scripted
  * more Transformations
  * build unit-tests
  * percentage-bias for word-level Transforms
  * granularity-handler for sentence-level

WAAAY Down the road, but a major goal:
  * planar-output and processing, not linear
