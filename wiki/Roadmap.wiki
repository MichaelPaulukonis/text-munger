  * save and reload text-sources (if in library or local files) 2012.03.28
  * basic editing control for SOURCE and OUTPUT 2012.03.27
    * This was pretty-much built-on, only now it's accessible via context-menu
  * added SNIPPETS window  2012.03.27

==TASKS (in no particular order)==
  * save and reload configured rule-sets
  * build unit-tests
  * added percentage bias to text sources
  * swap OUTPUT to SOURCE, for re-processing
  * more clustering random-walk for Density transform
  * drop xray-references in Markov rules
  * add explanation of rules to rule-editor (and whatever background code)
  * file-based generic replacement "translator" to read from directory

  * more Transformations
  * percentage-bias for word-level Transforms
